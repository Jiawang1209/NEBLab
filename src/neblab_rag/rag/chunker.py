"""Fixed-size character chunking with overlap.

For Sprint 2 we ship the simplest baseline: split on character count, with
a configurable overlap window so claims spanning a chunk boundary still
have full context in at least one chunk. Char-based (not token-based) on
purpose — works for Chinese and English uniformly without a tokenizer
dependency. Sprint 4 evaluation will tell us whether sentence-aware or
token-based splitting actually moves the quality needle.

Returns ``Chunk`` records with start/end offsets so we can recover the
exact source span (useful for citation cards and overlap math).
